This is a very simple C header file that defines as preprocessor macros 
some ANSI escape sequences to handle colour.

It is done out of sheer laziness to learn libraries such as curses.

Includes a simple usage test .

## Install

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd /path/to/repo`
2. `mv include/colour.h /usr/include`

## Usage

Just use this as you would any other C header:

`#include <colour.h>`
